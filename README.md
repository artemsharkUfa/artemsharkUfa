- 👋 Hi, I’m Artemу! 
- I am a member of the noderanner team. Our name is WingsNodeTeam (WNT). We are a young, ambitious and actively developing team.
- 🌱 Currently, I am developing skills in installing and maintaining test networks, at the early stages of various projects. 
- Not so long ago, a big boost in my development was provided by the near project and participation in stake-wars. 
- Where I learned how to back up a node, install a bot to track the health of my validator.
- 📫 You can contact me in the discard ID: Artem_Shark#0245
